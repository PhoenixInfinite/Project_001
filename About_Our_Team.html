        <p class="paragraph" id="para2">About our junior chemist and senior distribution manager, he is best known for his signature product chilli-p. Though not as popupar as the Glass grade crystals, his product has its own fan base led by tuco salamanca who refers the product as having an affect similar to being kicked by a mule on the balls wrapped in duct-tape,and if the salamancas approve of our Chilli-p creator jessie Pinkman no one can deny him or his product.</p>
